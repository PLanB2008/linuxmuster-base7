# room_defaults will be processed by /usr/sbin/linuxmuster-reset.
# It defines the default internet, intranet and webfilter status for all hosts
# of a room or a specific host.
#
# Four columns have to be present:
# room/host: room or host name as defined in /etc/linuxmuster/workstations
# internet status: on/off/-
# intranet status: on/off/-
# webfilter status: on/off/-
#
# Place a "-" in internet, intranet or webfilter column, if you want the current
# status not to be changed. 
#
# There has to be one room or host definition per line.
# Note: the rooms and hosts are processed in the sequence that is defined here.
# So place host definitions after the corresponding room definition to be sure
# the room definition can be overwritten by the host definition.
#
# room/host	internet status		intranet status		webfilter status
#
# Examples:
#r100		off			off			on
#r110		-			off			off
#r200		on			-			-
#r100-pc1	on			on			off
#
# next entry sets the default values for rooms/hosts, which are not defined
# explicitly.
default		on			on			on
